## Objective:
Create a full-stack, lightweight, single-page habit tracker.

### Functionality:
- create habits/tasks
    - allow selection of completion interval
        - pick date range for habit tracking ('indefinite' vs. 'until specified date', like studying for a specific exam for example)
        - pick various intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) 
            - various sub-intervals (_at least_ once a day, three times a week _regardless of day_, etc.))
    - allow selection of type of task 
        - success/failure ("went to bed on time YES/NO", "backed up security camera footage YES/NO")
        - range (e.g. "number of steps taken today", "hours spent studying today"))
- track habits over time to gain superficial insight into habit forming/strength of adherence to habits
